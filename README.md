# UrbanCart – A Simple Ecommerce Frontend

UrbanCart is a frontend web development project built as part of my AICTE internship with InternPe. This is my second project in the domain of web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

##  Project Objective

The goal of this project is to design a clean, responsive e-commerce interface where users can browse lifestyle products and proceed to a payment page. The focus is on building a user-friendly layout and implementing basic interactivity without using external libraries or frameworks.

##  Technologies Used

- **HTML** – for page structure and content
- **CSS** – for layout, design, and animations
- **JavaScript** – for interactivity and payment redirection


##  Features

- Fully responsive design using custom CSS
- Dynamic product listing with "Add to Cart" buttons
- Simple payment page that displays selected product and price
- Redirection using URL parameters and basic validation

##  How It Works

1. Users land on `index.html`, view a list of products, and click "Add to Cart".
2. This triggers a redirection to `payment.html` with the product and price as query parameters.
3. `payment.html` extracts these parameters and displays the purchase summary.
4. A confirmation button simulates payment completion.
